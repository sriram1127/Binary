1. To flip a bit at a particular position 

110 ^ 1 or 110 ^ (1<<1)  flips the bit at first position
101101 ^ (1<<4) flips the bit at 4th position 

2. representation a number in negative

take 2's complement and add 1 to it

3. To check even or odd number 

no & 1 == 1 Odd
no & 1 == 0 even

4. To move in the power of 2

1<<1 to 1 << 32;
2^0  to 2^32 

5. To get the right most set bit

a & -a

6. To check the given binary numbers a,b are consecutive gray codes

flip the last bit to one neighbour and left of the rightmost set bit to get another neighbour

return b = a ^ 1 OR b = a ^ ((a & -a) << 1);
