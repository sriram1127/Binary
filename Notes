1. Count the number of digits in a number 
(int)Math.log10(n) + 1

2.Integer to String
Integer.toString(12)  --> "12"

3. Space Complexities
Bubble Sort - O(1)
Insertion Sort - O(1)
Merge Sort - O(n)
Quick Sort - O(log n) for stack frames recursion.

4. () exclusive brackets
   [] inclusive brackets
  
5. Arrays.sort uses quick sort for primitive types and merge sort for Objects.
Quick is not stable where as merge sort is.
